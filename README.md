# Jekyll Money

A Jekyll plugin for dealing with money. Because we all have to at some point.

Works by extending the functionality of the popular [money](https://rubygems.org/gems/money) RubyGem. Intends to become a full-featured way to work with money in Jekyll. It starts with a simple filter to enable the common use case of formatting of international currencies. In time the plugin should be extended to create a [Tag](jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/#tags) enabling arithmetic, comparisons and currency conversion.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'jekyll-money'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-money

Then, in your `_config.yml` file, add to or make a new array with the key `plugins` and the values of the gem names of the plugins you'd like to use. In this case:

```yaml
plugins:
  - jekyll-money
```
Note: If using a version of Jekyll below `3.5.0`, use `gems:` in place of `plugins:`.

## Usage

Be default, the `money` helper formats a value as a USD currency amount using a Liquid filter.

```liquid
{{ 5000 | money }}
```
Outputs `$50.00`

```liquid
{{ 5000 | money: "GBP" }}
```
Outputs `Â£50.00`

```liquid
{{ 100000000 | money: "IDR" }}
```
Outputs `Rp1.000.000,00`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
